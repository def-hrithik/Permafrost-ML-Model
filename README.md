# ❄️ Permafrost-ML-Model  

## 📌 About  
The **Permafrost-ML-Model** is a machine learning project designed to predict **daily permafrost carbon emissions (CO₂-equivalent g/m²/day)** using environmental and soil parameters such as:  
- 🌡️ Soil temperature  
- 💧 Soil moisture  
- 🌱 Vegetation type  
- ❄️ Active layer thickness  
- 📈 Thaw degree days  

This model supports **climate scientists, researchers, and policymakers** by providing insights into permafrost thaw dynamics and their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Permafrost regions store vast amounts of organic carbon. As global temperatures rise, thawing permafrost releases **CO₂ and CH₄**, accelerating climate change. Traditional monitoring is costly and geographically limited.  

➡️ This project addresses that gap by developing a **data-driven prediction system** to estimate permafrost carbon emissions across regions like **Siberia, Alaska, Canada, and Scandinavia**.

## 🏆 Objectives  
- 🔹 Build a clean dataset with key soil and environmental variables.  
- 🔹 Explore the data to identify drivers of emissions.  
- 🔹 Train machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).  
- 🔹 Evaluate models with **RMSE, MAE, R²** metrics.  
- 🔹 Interpret feature importance using SHAP values.  
- 🔹 Provide a reproducible pipeline for future research.

## 📈 Future Work  
- 🛰️ Incorporate satellite and geospatial datasets.  
- ⏳ Develop time-series models (LSTM, RNN) for temporal prediction.  
- 🌍 Expand to methane (CH₄) predictions and total GHG flux.  
- ☁️ Deploy as a web app or API for real-time use.
